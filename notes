Goal: build a container for use in docker/podman
that is easy to use for organizations or at home
that prevents duplicate downloads of rpms from mirrors/download.o.o


https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32727594/how-to-pass-arguments-to-shell-script-through-docker-run
use $@ in entry script
can use perl GetOpt::Long to parse args

need to pass:
* backend (downloadcontent) server: default downloadcontent2/ 2a01:4f8:1c1c:e50d::1 80
* storage space: default: 5GB - can be non-persistent as varnish loses cache on restart anyway
* localmirror (important so that not everything is fetched from NUE - needs to be decently fresh to get timely updates)
* 2nd default backend for healthy checks + fallback?
* ?health check interval: default: 60s or keep things simple without health checks and fewer failovers  to not add 10000 req/min onto downloadcontent
* ttl+grace period: default 10s - how much staleness is acceptable?
* HTTP port: default 18080
* Proxy port: default 18081 (for use as backend to haproxy SSL)
* Purge ACL extra IPs for repopush integration

Handle SSL outside to simplify handling and reduce scope of this project.
=> move certbot forward into haproxy


Software needed in container: 
varnish
?mirrorcache + sqlite3 mode => better a separate container
?haproxy for backend ssl access
